Stress <-> Memory,"This experiment tests whether acute stress impairs memory consolidation. The proposed causal pathway is that stress exposure triggers cortisol release, which activates glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus and ultimately impairs memory consolidation.",Acute stress exposure (TSST vs. control condition),Memory performance (percentage of word pairs correctly recalled),Participants are fitted with galvanic skin response (GSR) electrodes and study a list of 16 semantically related word pairs for 5 minutes (encoding phase),N,Incorrect - please try again,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N
,,,,Participants are randomly assigned to either: - Stress condition: Complete the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) - 5 minutes of public speaking and mental arithmetic in front of evaluators - Control condition: Complete simple math problems and read a short passage quietly for the same duration,N,Incorrect - please try again,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N
,,,,GSR data is recorded continuously during the intervention to verify stress induction,Y,"Correct - GSR is an indicator of stress, but it is a direct measure of the hypothesized mediators.",Collect saliva samples to measure cortisol levels,Y,Use EEG to monitor stress-related brain activity,N,Measure blood pressure changes to measure stress levels,N,Use stress questionnaires before and after the stressor,N
,,,,Participants complete a 15-minute distractor task (sudoku puzzles),N,Incorrect - please try again,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N
,,,,Participants complete a cued recall test where they see the first word of each pair and must recall the second word,Y,Correct - this measure of memory might be influenced by factors outside our hypothesized mediators.,Use fMRI to measure hippocampal activity during the memory task,Y,Use a follow-up test at 24 hours to measure long-term retention,N,Compare the GSR stress response for correct and incorrect answers.,N,Ask subjects to rate their confidence for each word pair.,N
Caffeine <-> Cognitive performance,"This experiment tests whether caffeine improves cognitive performance. The proposed causal pathway is that caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, which normally promote a feeling of sleepiness. This blockage improves alertness, leading to improved cognitive performance.",Caffeine,Cognitive performance,Subjects are randomly assigned to receive a 200mg caffeine pill or identical-appearing placebo.,Y,Correct - the dosage might not be an appropriate amount for each individual.,Ensure that subjects have not taken caffeine before the experiment,Y,Survey the subjects to identify a reasonable dosage based on their average daily intake,Y,Provide caffeinated and decaf coffee instead of a pill and placebo.,N,Measure heart rate to ensure that the caffeine has an effect.,N
,,,,Subjects wait 45 minutes for the caffeine to take effect.,N,Incorrect - please try again,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N
,,,,"Subjects complete a simple reflex task of pressing the spacebar as quickly as possible when a red circle appears on screen, while they attempt to solve simple arithmetic problems.",N,Incorrect - please try again,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N,NA,N
,,,,Average reflex time and total number of correct arithmetic problems are calculated as measures of cognitive performance.,Y,Correct - these measures a,"Use a comprehensive set of tests that include working memory, attention, and executive function tasks.",Y,Use both visual and auditory stimuli to test reflexes,N,Use word association in addition to mathquestions,N,Measure reflex time before caffeine to establish a baseline.,N
